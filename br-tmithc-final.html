<h1>Do Nazi Androids Dream of Stechschritt Sheep?</h1>

<p>David Hardin and Anna Hardin</p>

<p>Ridley Scott's <em>Blade Runner</em> assaults the senses from the first frame, plunging us into a hellish Los Angeles of 2019, accompanied by Vangelis' haunting score -- a claustrophobic world of fire, rain, smog, and desperation. As the future noir drama plays out, questions pile upon questions, as we descend from the massive pyramid of the Tyrell Corporation to the deteriorating streets below. What is going on here? What has happened to the city? An ecological disaster, to be sure -- the climate is wrecked, and the only animals to be found are artificial. What has happened to the people? Most of the "fittest" have apparently been lured off-world, and those who remain are a forlorn, multi-ethnic mass worthy of the despairing refugees in Casablanca. Who is Human, and who is a Replicant? This is Deckard's problem as the film begins, but it increasingly becomes the viewer's conundrum as the story unfolds. How many heated 3 AM college dorm debates have taken up the question of, "Is Deckard a Replicant?"</p>

<p>Yet, as the questions pile up, one is buried, or perhaps never
asked: is this Los Angeles supposed to be our future, or another LA on
a vastly different timeline? In particular, is <em>Blade Runner</em> set in the future of another Philip K. Dick alternative reality, that of <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>? To be clear, the PKD books <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em> and <em>The Man in the High Castle</em> do <em>not</em> occur in the same universe; too many discrepancies exist between the worlds of those two works to make that assertion. We do, however, claim that Ridley Scott's <em>Blade Runner</em> and his upcoming adaptation of <em>TMITHC</em> exist in the same dystopian universe, one in which the Axis won World War II, and proceeded to divide America into Japanese (west coast) and German (east coast and Midwest) regions, with a narrow Neutral Zone along the Rocky Mountains. If we accept this geopolitical context, then many of <em>Blade Runner</em>'s seemingly odd details begin to make more sense.</p>

<h2>Here's Another Clue for You All...</h2>

<p>Clues abound to suggest that in the world of <em>Blade Runner</em>,
American culture is on the wane. In the opening scene, we fly over the
violent, fiery petroleum works (no EPA in this future, apparently) and
come upon the massive Tyrell Corporation pyramids (3:54[<a href="#noteTime">1</a>]). These are hardly the soaring, streamlined, glass-clad towers favored by corporate America in our timeline; rather these are heavy, soulless, oppressive structures, reminiscent of the statist architecture of the Third Reich or the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Later, as we fly towards the city center, the 50-story video geishas selling candies (7:25) and cigarettes are the most prominent signs that the culture of LA has taken on a distinctly Asian flavor, an impression that is confirmed as we enter Deckard's street-level world. The police officer accompanying Gaff at the noodle bar wears a uniform sporting a patch which appears to be a portrait surrounded by kanji characters (9:03), and wears a protective vest bearing a resemblance to Japanese samurai armor (9:37). Also, the flying police spinners feature kanji characters as part of their signage (9:56). Scott furthers this aesthetic by featuring classical Japanese biwa music in the soundtrack (1:13:00 and 1:39:00), and littering Deckard's apartment with decorative elements which suggest Asian culture -- a folding screen, a bonsai plant, a statue of the head of Buddha.</p>

<p>At first blush, this may be written off as the inevitable result of increasing Asian influence on the west coast. Besides, most of the <em>Blade Runner</em> street scenes may simply happen to occur in a future Chinatown -- the rest of LA may be quite different. But, what if this were not just a cultural invasion, but a literal one, by Japanese troops and the civilians who followed them? The presence of kanji on police emblems, then, may belie the direct influence of the Japanese empire over quotidian U.S. affairs. It would also explain the fact that the fashions in <em>Blade Runner</em> look back to the 1940s. Do the retro fashions indicate a nostalgia for the last gasp of American freedom? One could argue the fashions are merely meant to invoke Casablanca, or are an homage to film noir; we argue that they could signify much more.</p>

<p>German cultural influence, though perhaps not as prevalent, is not absent from the film. Upon Deckard's first meeting with Rachael, we witness decorative elements on the Tyrell headquarters that are reminiscent of the Nazi eagle (16:22). Later we see Rachael walk past two large, golden eagle statues as she approaches (17:12). While these could be another sign of the reverence with which animals are treated in this narrative universe, they are also undeniably a symbol evocative of the Nazi regime. One could counter that despite the architecture and the eagles, Tyrell Corporation is headed by an American, not a German. While this is true, a scene involving a German Tyrell Senior Vice President was shot for the film, but was left on the cutting room floor[<a href="#noteGerman">2</a>]. Later, as J.F. Sebastian and Pris enter J.F.'s apartment, they are greeted by two of his biologically engineered "toys", one of whom has been crafted as a small caricature of Kaiser Wilhelm. Regardless of whether J.F. scavenged the tiny replicant's costume or created it himself, its presence suggests a lingering cultural familiarity which would be in keeping with a territorial and political takeover by the Axis powers.</p>

<p>Everywhere one looks in the stunning sets of <em>Blade Runner</em>, one encounters a run-down, haphazardly patched city, one overlaid with the symbols of a futuristic police state. The ever-present police spinners, the imposing maintenance vehicles, the blaring blimp advertising for the off-world colonies, the invasive searchlights, even the intimidating parking meters, gives the impression that this is the land of the conquered, and the home of the afraid. Even Deckard the Blade Runner is harassed by the police (1:27:48); and at one point, Scott shows Deckard's vehicle through what appears to be the fisheye lens of a surveillance camera (30:40). And while the Axis powers were hardly alone in establishing a police state, the name of the replicant-detecting machine used by the police, Voight-Kampff, is certainly suggestive. Finally, there is the replicant Roy Batty: the ruthless, supremely powerful, blond-and-blue-eyed prodigal Aryan son (1:25:30). Is the battle with Deckard, resulting in Batty's eventual degradation and death, more than a battle for the integrity of the human race? Could it also represent a victory of American persistence over the temporary dominion of the Axis?</p>


<h2>A Linguistic Mischung</h2>

<p>Another prominent cultural feature of <em>Blade Runner</em> is its blend of languages. Japanese, not surprisingly, is common. The counterman in the noodle bar scene (8:22-8:50), for example, initially speaks solely in Japanese as he invites Deckard to sit and dine, although he later speaks in English as well. Japanese chatter can also be heard on the police radio in Gaff's flying police spinner (10:05). Korean also makes a brief appearance: the beat cop accompanying Gaff beckons to Deckard with "Hey, idi-wa" ("Hey, come here") (9:03).</p>

<p>But the establishment of a multilingual cultural environment extends further. In the same scene, and throughout the film, the character of Gaff employs "Cityspeak", a mixture of French, German, Hungarian, Japanese, and Korean developed largely by the actor Edward James Olmos[<a href="#noteGaff">3</a>][<a href="#noteVoice">4</a>]. Cityspeak is puzzling at first: why are Central European languages so prominent? Gaff, for example, can be heard using the French "Monsieur", German "bitte" (please), and several words in Hungarian, all in the same sentence. This seems to suggest significant European cultural influence in the city, very possibly expedited by forced integration following a German invasion.</p>

<p>In keeping with this theory, spoken German is heard throughout <em>Blade Runner</em>. Replicant Leon Kowalski's address is given as "1187 at Hunterwasser" (5:28)[<a href="#noteHunter">5</a>] -- an unusual address for LA. German chatter can also be heard on the police radio (e.g., at 10:20). The elevator Deckard uses to reach his apartment utters a German "Danke" faintly after the English equivalent, "Thank you", after Deckard gives his name and floor number (31:02). The street urchins who vandalize Deckard's car speak entirely in German (1:27:12-1:27:27), with no trace of the other languages comprising Cityspeak. Why would street kids be speaking German, unless German had become much more prevalent and influential in the history of Deckard's Los Angeles than in our own?</p>

<p>The Japanese element of Cityspeak (Gaff utters a non-standard Japanese sentence in his initial confrontation with Deckard, as well as a confirmatory "hai") certainly makes sense, given the visual clues that have been presented thus far in the film; but German? Why not Spanish, for example[<a href="#noteSpanish">6</a>]? After all, by casting an actor of Latin heritage and giving him vaguely Asian features, Ridley Scott could easily have made Gaff a hybrid Latin-Japanese character. But, Gaff is not that, as his oddly blue eyes (not Olmos' natural color) and Central-European-influenced dialogue indicate. On the other hand, if one considers a future world in which the Axis powers have prevailed, Cityspeak suddenly makes much more sense.</p>

<p>And as for Gaff? Perhaps he's an Axis hybrid. If so, the racial purity obsessions on both sides of his family would make life very difficult for him. The Los Angeles Police Department is probably the only employer that would have him and give him a sense of importance, as the sort of on-the-street police work Gaff performs is enhanced, rather than impeded, by his evident mixed heritage.</p>

<h2>Space: The Final Nazi Frontier</h2>

<p>A recurring topic in <em>TMITHC</em> is that the Germans have invested heavily in space travel, nearly bankrupting themselves in the process. In <em>TMITHC</em>, by the early 1960s the Germans have built the equivalent of the failed American "Orient Express" spaceplane, allowing travel between Germany and San Francisco in under an hour. If one accepts our premise, then it is not too surprising that space colonization would be well underway during the time of <em>Blade Runner</em> (given the usual optimism that science fiction stories have about such things). Note also that the space colonization theme gives <em>Blade Runner</em> an opportunity to subtly introduce the themes of expansionism and eugenics into the story (lest we overstate things here, <em>DADOES</em> also includes space colonization, and as we've noted, <em>DADOES</em> is not on the same timeline as <em>TMITHC</em>). Obviously, the expansion into space is not going as smoothly as the blimp advertising claims. Roy Batty, during the emotional monologue just before his death (1:46:22-1:47:17), speaks of "attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion." Interestingly, during the monologue (partially improvised by Rutger Hauer), Batty makes reference to "the Tanhauser Gate" (script spelling) (1:46:41), a very Germanic-sounding name[<a href="#noteWagner">7</a>].</p>

<p>Not everyone, however, is welcome off-world. J.F. Sebastian, for example, has been denied passage to the off-world colonies based on his "Methusela Syndrome" (1:14:25), symptoms of which include accelerated aging. As with many details of <em>Blade Runner</em>, Sebastian's condition serves more than one purpose: it comments on the discriminatory practices of the government in <em>Blade Runner</em>, while also giving him a reason to have empathy for the Replicants (as they both experience accelerated aging). Stretching this idea a little further, following our conjecture about Gaff's hybrid nature, it is easy to imagine that his heritage (and its concomitant socioeconomic standing) keeps him and others like him Earth-bound.</p>

<p>Finally, the colonization of space gives both <em>DADOES</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> the opportunity to comment on the notion of a "disposable Earth". In both works, planet Earth has undergone an ecological disaster. In <em>DADOES</em>, the immediate cause is fallout from a nuclear war; in <em>Blade Runner</em>, a primary cause is never stated, but it is obvious that our home world is being treated as a lost cause.</p>

<h2>Signs and Portents...and Unicorns</h2>

<p>The theory that <em>Blade Runner</em> exists in the future of <em>TMITHC</em> was developed into a half-formed notion by one of us (DH) a few years ago. The authors had discussed some of the "clues" in <em>Blade Runner</em>, but we made no serious attempt to document them. What spurred us to action was the pilot for Ridley Scott's adaptation of <em>TMITHC</em> on Amazon. In particular, we were motivated by the appearance of the unicorn origami in the cafe in the Neutral Zone town of Canon City (<em>TMITHC</em> Pilot, 54:06). Internet commenters have characterized this as a sly wink from Ridley Scott to fans, saying, "Yes, it's me, Ridley, and I'm back doing another Philip K. Dick adaptation." But, what if the origami unicorn has a deeper meaning? What if it's the true symbol of the Resistance, a common Resistance in both <em>Blade Runner</em> and in the pilot for <em>TMITHC</em>?</p>

<p>Much has been said about Deckard's unicorn vision (42:04-42:22). Many have pointed to this brief scene as evidence that Deckard is a replicant; that his vision is a memory implant. Gaff, aware of the memory implants that Replicants receive, and having exhibited his skill as an origami commentator throughout <em>Blade Runner</em>, makes the unicorn origami and leaves it outside Deckard's apartment door as a sign that he knows (1:52:00) what Deckard is. Is the origami unicorn a warning that Gaff is coming after Deckard and Rachael? Or a signal that he is turning his back and letting them go? It is difficult to say, with the evidence of <em>Blade Runner</em> alone.</p>

<p>Considering the appearance of the origami unicorn in the pilot for <em>TMITHC</em>, and the reappearance of origami in relation to clandestine dealings in the recently-previewed second episode of the series, this seems increasingly likely. Gaff's origami can now be seen as a signal to Deckard and Rachel to run to the Neutral Zone and seek out others in the Resistance to Axis rule. Gaff, in this interpretation, may well be a Resistance agent. If we assume that Gaff is an Axis hybrid, we can see how he would have no great love for the Axis, and would perhaps seek to work against it. And what better way to work as a Resistance agent than by taking a position in the LA Police Department? Of course, there is also the possibility that Gaff is yet another Replicant, but we leave that discussion for another day.</p>

<p>Then we have the unicorn vision itself. If it was an implanted memory, it would have most likely been put there by Dr. Tyrell, as he designed the minds of the Replicants. If so, why did he do it? If the Unicorn is a Resistance symbol, is Tyrell secretly sympathetic to their plight?</p>

<p>The evolution of this resistance, it seems, may be documented through the <em>TMITHC</em> series, culminating in Deckard's perseverance at the conclusion of <em>Blade Runner</em>. But, even if this is the case, questions remain. Is Ridley Scott building a universe spanning multiple, seemingly unconnected narratives? And if so, which of his existing or future works may be part of that universe?</p>
